    text: "For the first track in this year’s series, we want to emphasize a beginner-friendly, user-focused design. As the name suggests, your goal is not to come up with a new, ground-breaking application/website that will blow people’s mind. Rather, the objective is to recreate ideas that have already been tried and tested throughout the years. Think to the apps and websites you yourself use everyday: instead of on creativity, your submission will be assessed based on your ability to understand why those applications are so successful and whether or not you’re able to recreate that desirability. We recommend this track for beginner coders.",

    text: "In direct contrast to track #1, ‘Ground Zero’ is all about hard skills. In an era of abstracted tools, vibe coding, and all kinds of GPT wrappers, we wanted to give contestants a chance to return to basics and really focus on showing off pure skill and knowledge. The tl;dr of this track is ‘for coders, by coders’: contestants will be asked to create something that is either a tool for the use of other developers, or a tool that would impress other developers. Whether it be with a deep understanding of network protocols, compilers, OS, anything that shows you know your stuff! Recommended for experienced coders.",

    text: "For the hackathon purists: our final track fits the standard experience you’re used to: a simple prompt that narrows downs the scope for your creativity. In this case: agriculture! Your goal is to research and understand issues faced by stakeholders in agriculture and then to design an application that helps address said issue. Contestants will be expected to show the ability to properly research and explain their topic of focus. Recommended for those with a good grasp of UI/UX principles.",
