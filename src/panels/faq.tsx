        <>
          While attendance is not mandatory, we will have areas of campus booked
          out for the Opening Ceremony, Closing Ceremony, and the periods in
          between. Study areas will be booked on campus from early morning
          (10:00am) to late evening (9:00pm) to ensure all contestants have a
          space where they can collaborate with teammates!

          Yes! There will be food and drinks provided for all days of the
          hackathon! This event is also supported by RedBull, so the energy
          stays high!

      question: "How will mentoring work?",
      answer: (
        <>
          We will have mentoring sessions starting from day 1 right after the
          Opening Ceremony. Mentors will introduce themselves to contestants and
          wander around a bit. Teams will also be able to use Discord to put in
          official mentoring requests with their location and issue.

      question: "How do I find a team?",
      answer: (
        <>
          There will be a team-forming exercise right after the Opening Ceremony
          for those who do not have a team! In addition, the Discord server will
          also have a team-finding forum!

          Please use the Codebrew Discord server as all announcements during the
          event will be posted there!
